PROCESS FOR COMPLETING THE TASK.
Step 1:
Having installed Node.js and VSCode and created the directory, the Express library needs to be installed in the directory from the terminal using npm i express. This also adds it as a dependency to the application, as seen in the package.json file and node-modules sub-directory.

Step 2:
In the index.js file, the express library is called to created the server and link the html file in the public folder. It then set the port as 400.

Step3:
3 functions were created to build out the application for practice purposes. They are not related to the html file or api.

Step 4:
Establish an api to deonmstrate the callback function.

Step 5:
Run the application from the terminal, using node index.js, thus initiating the server and running the code in the js file and enabling the html file to be accessed from the browser. This also calls the functions and posts the output to the terminal.
